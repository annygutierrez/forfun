        description: 'I watched this movie for the first time when I was 8 years old, and I remember that even when I didn’t really understand most scenes, there were some of them that got stucked on my mind, the way the refugies screamed to get help from the American soldiers, the gold bars and expensive cars in the middle of so much poverty, and that scene in which the terrorists throw a bomb to one of the American’s cars and ‘If you leave me now’ is banging on the background, that was epic.

        description: 'I wish I had seen this movie when I was younger, I watched it in 2021, we were still traped inside our home because of covid, and I wanted to watch a classic movie, like the ones that were very popular in the 80’s, specially because through 2020 and 2021 there was an avalanche of pop culture inspired in the 80’s. I should say that this really surprised me, I wasn’t expecting as many funny things as I saw. Nevertheless, this movie let me with a bittersweet flavor in my mouth, that line Ferris said at the end of the film ‘Life moves pretty fast. If you don’t stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.’ made me think about how different my life would’ve been if someone had told me that before, I felt kind of jelous that I didn’t figure that out until two or three years after I finished school.  And of course this movie also fed my love for classical New York culture, something that I learn to love since I was a child because my mom used to watch too many New York movies.',
