        description: ['I watched this movie for the first time when I was 8 years old, and I remember that even when I didn’t really understand most scenes, there were some of them that got stucked on my mind, the way the refugies screamed to get help from the American soldiers, the gold bars and expensive cars in the middle of so much poverty, and that scene in which the terrorists throw a bomb to one of the American’s cars and ‘If you leave me now’ is banging on the background, that was epic.

            'I wish I had seen this movie when I was younger, I watched it in 2021, we were still traped inside our home because of covid, and I wanted to watch a classic movie, like the ones that were very popular in the 80’s, specially because through 2020 and 2021 there was an avalanche of pop culture inspired in the 80’s.',
            <span>I should say that this really surprised me, I wasn’t expecting as many funny things as I saw. Nevertheless, this movie let me with a bittersweet flavor in my mouth, that line Ferris said at the end of the film <strong>‘Life moves pretty fast. If you don’t stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.’</strong> made me think about how different my life would’ve been if someone had told me that before, I felt kind of jelous that I didn’t figure that out until two or three years after I finished school.  And of course this movie also fed my love for classical New York culture, something that I learn to love since I was a child because my mom used to watch too many New York movies.</span>

            'This one was pretty interesting, because it’s about a bunch of adolescents daring each other to do life threatening things, which I though was stupid but at the same time made me relate myself to the main character, because I could find some parallels with my life and the movie, like when Sydney dare Vee to talk to her crush and when she refused, Sydney called her a watcher, which made me think if I was a watcher in real life, and if I was risking enough not only to achieve my dreams but also to live life as someone as young as I was would, because life is not everlasting.',
            'Another scene that made me think was the fight between Vee and Sydney, when Sydney told Vee that they worked as bestfriends because she was boring and the only thing interesting about her was her brother; personally this line was very relatable to me because I am not a very social person and I can be percibed sometimes as boring. And there was another scene in which Vee answered Sydney that they friendship worked because she always did everything Sydney wanted; which made me remember how I felt around my friends in school.',
            'A very exciting movie with a very personal meaning to me. I recommend this 100%.'

            'Originally, this movie came out in 2012, but by then I couldn’t afford going to the movies, or going to anywhere really, so by the time I finally could watch the movie it was 2016.',
            'The year I watched this movie was one of the hardest years of my life, I had plenty of family issues, I didn’t have economic or emotional support from anyone, and the future was looking pretty depressing. I got the habit of watching all those movies I’ve ever wanted to watch as a coping mecanism to scape from my reality and when I got to this movie, it hit me, and probably understood it better than I’d do if I had watched it when I was 14 years old.',
            <span>This movie became one of my favorites, and of course, the scene in which Emma Watson is on the open back of the pickup was pure magic, the final thoughts that make you ask yourself . . . <strong>‘When do I feel infinite?’</strong>.</span>
